//Question : Can you prove that a String object in Java is immutable programmatically?

//String object is considered immutable because once itâ€™s created, we cannot change its content.

//if the references are equal, then those 2 strings are mutable (i.e s2 overrides s2)
//if the references are not equal, then those 2 strings are immmutable (i.e two strings are same)
